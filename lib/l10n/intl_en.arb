This might improve performance if your system is opening and closing many files in the same fileset and is not already using large amounts of system memory for other apps or for cache memory. If your computer is already using large amounts of system memory for other apps or for cache memory, increasing the limit of NTFS paged and non-paged pool memory reduces the available pool memory for other processes. This might reduce overall system performance.\n\nDefault is Off",
